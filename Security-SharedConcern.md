# Security - A Shared Concern
 
Security is a shared concern between InfoSec, Platform, and Development/Deployment teams. Every enterprise defines a security policy outlining a set of security controls designed to meet  regulatory compliance requirements, standards, baselines and guidelines to be followed. InfoSec is responsible for  implementing and enforcing these controls. Traditionally, the enforcement has been achieved by introducing manual approvals through a change control process. Though the traditional enforcement process worked in the past, two factors are contributing to changing old notions and pushing InfoSec team to rethink enforcement process. Those factors are:

    * For InfoSec community, Identity is becoming the new security parameter and management of identities form the core component of any approach implementing modern trust architecture. NIST SP 800-207 also advocates an identity centric architecture.  

    * Traditional development & deployment lifecycle was based on the principles of systems engineering but modern lifecycle is based on the principles of agility and velocity to meet ever evolving and growing business requirements.  

Following sections further outline specific security management requirements by different teams for managing machine identities in modern IT infrastructures.
